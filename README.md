Refracted html VS formatter
Fixed the broken link by adding id ie <div id="search-engine-optimization"
Tried some semantic html per course material by nesting footer in <footer>
Added clearer context to head title
Improved grammar and removed the Article "the" from Online Reputation Management gives 
  you (the) control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
 Added Footer tag no problem and tried Section tags but they messed with the positioning.
